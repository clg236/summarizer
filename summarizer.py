manual_transcript = "hi everybody Welcome to our discussion on the economics of digital so as we delve into this session uh we'll work to uncover the ways in which digital representation uh creates value we'll talk about how exponential growth in computing power and Morris law reduces costs and opens up new possibilities and will will also touch upon what modularity is and how that can also help to enable kind of a positive feedback loop of Innovations so before we begin I would like to give thanks to my wonderful colleague Arun sundararajan who was the inspiration for a lot of this content many of these slides we recently taught a version of this course uh to Stern's new business technology and Entrepreneurship cohort the second second cohort technically and it went very well um so thank you Arun um all right so let's go over the agenda so basically what we're going to start with is I'll quickly recap week one just have a slide on that um next we'll talk about the economics of digital and I'll specifically highlight these three things that make digital different which is representation growth and computing power and modularity and once we've done that we will do a bit of a deep dive into how these three qualities help us to realize some diff different diff or differentiate you know digital in terms of you know physical I suppose um so we'll talk about the economics of infinity and its cost structure we will talk about the opportunity to serve hyper Niche markets and what the long tail is and why that's important and then lastly we'll talk about the impacts of digital disinformediation uh on businesses all right so to recap just quickly uh what we did last week so we began hopefully by understanding the fundamental language of computers and that is the binary encoding system when you talk about digital you're talking about by binary um everything at its core boils down to a series of zeros and ones next we explored ASCII which is a character encoding standard standard and that translates our textual data into binary and vice versa it's like the bridge between human readable text and the Machine and then even deeper we discuss the hexadecimal system which is space 16 and that's a more human friendly way of representing binary data opinion especially when you're dealing with larger binary sequences and related to that we talked about colors and how colors are represented digitally and that hopefully gave you some insights into how your devices are displaying millions of colors um and you know how they're how those colors are actually being encoded um into red green and blue pixels so keep these Concepts in the back of your mind because we're going to jump into digital representation right now all right digital representations are all around us so think of the books and think think of you know news music video all of that type of entertainment that we're consuming think about the way that it's being distributed how it's being monetized um how it's being you know it's basically like undergone radical shifts in the past decade the way that we are consuming you know say entertainment media medical images for instance are now digitized this is leading to better Diagnostics and storage and sharing capabilities having this information represented digitally is now allowing new AI tools uh the one on the the top photo is from a Siemens uh marketing site that basically boasts about being able to diagnose a complex knee issue in minutes and whereas it might have taken hours before we have many many instances in finance and money which was once a tangible asset has seen significant transformations in the form of digital currencies real-time Global money flows online transactions and e-commerce um the vast document like the vast majority of business documents are now digitized and this leads to more efficient processes Storage Solutions data-driven decision making I mean I can remember when I was a student at NYU I worked in a department I won't name it and we were still faxing documents since I'm dating myself here but we were still faxing documents but the the digital representation revolution had already happened but you know that was still occurring right so it was still dealing in an analog world but again related to that business processes have also been optimized and Tran and transformed using digital tools uh in the age of social media and online reviews reputation has become a digital asset businesses and individuals um both have to manage and cultivate their digital representation um I wouldn't say they don't they must do that but many of them must because this directly now impacts trust and credibility in the online space so if you notice that a restaurant has maybe some poor reviews or doesn't have a lot of reviews you might be less inclined to eat at that restaurant whereas if you see it has many many reviews and they're all fairly good you'd be more inclined too right so that's a now a digital ass that's now a digital asset to that business their reputations I said both natural and human created things are increasingly finding their digital representations be it in the form of 3D models or virtual replicas or digital twins so all of these points really underscore to me the this profound there are profound economic implications resulting from these from digital representation itself um and it's reshaped Industries as we know and it continues to do that and continues to create new Industries so as we kind of move deeper into this area of digital economics I think it's a it's essential for you to understand really three main points um and I see these as foundational benefits of digital representation so like why do we prefer digital formats over traditional ones so let's kind of break it down a bit so at the core we know computers have a language of their own this is binary so digital representation it's enabling computers to process this vast amount of diverse information by converting it into a language that they inherently understand zeros and ones um and you know I think that's important so you know have you ever kind of wondered why an image or appears in a certain way all the time or a song sounds the same you know whether you you know no matter where you're listening to it uh smartphone your laptop tablet whatever any device and that's another piece I think is very important which is it's the the magic of standardizing digital representations it's ensuring that this data remains consistent irrespective of the platform or the device that you're using I think that's another big benefit of digital representation and then lastly you know in our connected World we're constantly sending Digi sending and receiving uh digital information and I think digital representation it's optimizing that process for us it's allowing for this efficient and Rapid transmission over our networks it could be a simple text message but it could be you know something more complex like a video call or even arguably more complex transferring a very large file you know and but digital representation is allowing all of that to be really really efficient um right so when we talk about digital representation it's tempting to view this as a sudden leap of old to new but in reality it's an evolution or I see it as an evolution take music for example um we don't jump from cassette tapes directly to platforms like Spotify the streaming music there's something in the middle you know first came the MP3 players which still had many physical limitations of storage but over time uh you know as technology improved as Internet speeds improved we arrive at a streaming platform like Spotify which offers us an almost unlimited library of songs you know just at our fingertips and this journey to me underscores the kind of the essence of digital representation not just being about ditch the physical form but enhance the value in terms of accessibility experience and customization so thinking about this this journey that the cassette tape took um and you know all the way over to Spotify or the music industry but before I jump into that I do sorry for this relatively complex slide I did want to talk there's one other element to digital representation I didn't really discuss much in week one because we didn't have a lot of time but I wanted to give a little bit of an example of representing audio digitally just so you have this kind of in the back of your mind so um what this what this graphic is essentially trying to communicate is this process of representing audio data sound data digitally so we have this concept of digital sampling so at the core of audio you know representation is this process of sampling so analog sound waves the way this works is analog sound waves are sampled at these intervals and converted into zeros and ones Digital Data this is called analog to digital conversion not surprisingly and imagine like you're trying to capture a cross-section of a river uh you know a flowing river at multiple points along that River and you just take a screenshot of it or whatever you do take a photograph of it at certain you know certain points maybe you do this if 44 000 times a second and then you know you have almost a way to recreate the flow of that River so that's the first thing to keep in mind is this concept of sampling and the second one is once we've sampled you know our audio we need to represent each of those samples in binary and that's something called the bit rate so you know we we want to represent this sample so the bitrate basically denotes like how much data is used for each second of audio so a higher bit rate means we have more bits and we have more data every second so we're going to capture more details so it's like almost like the resolution of your phone so if you have like a very potato quality like phone um it's going to have a pretty low bit rate when you're taking a picture of that River um I hope that River example works I kind of just made that up off the top of my head um so just keeping this in the back of your mind uh should should help you especially as we think about now we've represented a song we've represented a song digitally like what's that look like okay so now let's talk about the benefits of digital like in this audio sphere just as you know take this kind of continue with this theme of like cassette tape MP3 player Spotify so first we have consistent playback so once we're in a digital format audio can be played back consistently without degradation um the traditional analog formats you know they will experience some degradation over time so you know your favorite song is going to sound just the same and just as good on its 100th playback as it did on its first whereas at on a cassette that's not going to be the case and the second piece is we have compression and storage so digital audio is going to allow for more efficient compression I'll talk about compression on a couple a couple slides later that means we can store vast amounts of like libraries of songs podcasts recordings almost an unlimited amount and this really did revolutionize the music industry and it revolutionizes the way that we all consume audio content next we have really easy distribution and sharing so think about the platforms we talked about like Spotify or apple music or podcast steps digital audio representation has really made the distribution sharing streaming of audio content like seamless and totally Global like I can listen to a radio station in Japan in real time right now if I want um all over the internet all digitally represented I don't need to be nearby the you know Tokyo Tower or something lastly we you know we have enhancements and modifications so um you know an entire life I was a sound engineer so I you know I I just think about digital audio formats meaning it's so much easier to to do things like reduce the noise or on a track or equalize something or add some sort sort of special effect um all of that is much much easier um when we're you know when we have this audio digitally represented um right so kind of going even deeper into the rabbit hole here just talk about the MP3 player like when we Marvel at this convenience of digitally represented audio and you should after hopefully you do after listening and to all of this um it's easy to overlook the sheer amount of data that's really involved and I want to just like kind of go into the intricacies of digital audio storage and in the magic of compression just for a second so you know we have raw digital audio data is a total space hog um it's very rich in detail right it's being sampled at a very high I bitrate now that I say that you're you're like I get what that means um so this comes at a cost of significant storage uh to put it in perspective like a CD quality song with pretty high fidelity consumes a lot of space so it's sampled at 44.1 kilohertz that's 44 I think 44 000 times a second using 16 bits per sample so you can see okay every sample 16 bits 16 ones or zeros um and then you have it in Stereo so you need to account for those two channels the left and the right you're looking at about 10 minutes uh 10 sorry 10 megabytes for roughly every minute of audio so in a CD at that point they could store about 70 minutes of Music um now enter the MP3 player so this is where kind of in my mind like the digital age really shows its prowess so we're familiar with MP3 it's a it's a name of a it's an audio format it's a compressed audio format um and it's not just like a compression Marvel like well it really is but you know by basically what it's doing is it's encoding audio and it's intelligently the MP3 algorithm you could say it's kind of intelligently determining which parts of the sound Spectrum are less critical to human hearing like um and I'm simplifying but I could say oh if the sounds are above a certain frequency we're just gonna you know call those and we're not going to include those or if they're below a certain frequency we're not going to include those um and what this be what this What MP3 then allows is we can then take you know the same things that sound the same um and intelligently encode and intelligently represent in terms of ones and zeros like the the music itself and this drastically reduces the file size and just to give you an impression like kind of an idea here that there's this thing called a compression ratio um which is in this case for mp3 it's like 11 to 1. so you're shrinking this to 1 11th the size of its raw CD quality counterpart that I said earlier and this is really that's again really revolutionizing how we store share and stream music as if it's in an MP3 format it's much smaller so in essence you know the while raw audio data is I guess unparalleled quality the Innovations like an MP3 which sound arguably just as good um people are going to argue with audio files are going to be no they're not as good at all but really they do ensure that we can carry like entire music libraries in our pocket and this is like I'm talking as back far back as 2001 you know looking at this first gen iPod you know it had five gigabytes of storage on it which might not sound like a lot but that was enough to store a thousand songs um right but if you if you compress it in in a five gigabyte gigabyte iPad iPod sorry I keep saying iPad but um you could fit many many more could fit about I think my math was like 15. thousand um sorry that's 15 000 uncompressed songs and an MP3 is an eleven to one which means you're about a hundred and sixty thousand songs um which kind of led me to ask this question who needs a hundred and fifty thousand songs and this is back in the Gen 1 iPod 2001. so right at first glance the vast storage like of these devices even back then might make this idea of compressing audio kind of obsolete like why compress when a device can hold hundreds of thousands of songs however you know we have to think a little less selfishly I guess um the digital landscape or the ecosystem of all the things that are connected to enable this to happen this meaning you listening to music on a iPod even a gen 1 iPod is about more than just storage right it's also about accessibility it's about efficiency it's about the user experience so you want to conserve bandwidth you want to ensure smooth stream streaming to optimize costs if your Spotify we care about our battery life right so extending the battery life for users is is important if you're compressing your audio that's less data that's that has to kind of come through your Computing pipeline um so audio compression is still super important I don't want everybody to think oh like why bother compressing it when storage size just gets so much bigger like five gigabytes is a joke I have a terabyte on my yep still it's still important um and furthermore you know advancements in compression really the algorithms that that compress that raw the raw zeros and ones um is becoming higher quality right so it's kind of this I guess we'll have to think of the idea of compression and we'll talk about compression later in the semester in more detail um it's a balancing act and I think that that's something that's that's important and I bet you in your mind you're thinking maybe even about video right you're thinking about oh wow there's there's compression in video there's a lot of compression and video and you know it it's it's quite good in my opinion yeah so again why do we compress so just to highlight this for you so first we have efficiency in data compression so data is always on the Move um when you're streaming music you're downloading your is sending and receiving data compression means less data to transfer at least to faster download times less strain on networks less energy usage and the data centers you also have reduced storage and processing costs storage is cheaper but it's not only about space like reduced file sizes like that 11 to 1 ratio they directly translate to reduced storage costs moreover you know smaller file sizes can be processed faster which I mentioned and that's saving you money and it's saving you battery and then we have yeah the enhanced user experience which is you have this longer battery life you have faster response times all right so let's move on to kind of Point number two and made a lot of points but the main kind of the main anchors of this so we've talked about digital representation I want to move on to the second one which is the exponential growth in computing power so we cannot Overlook the astonishing rate at which computing power has evolved and I think central to this narrative is something called Moore's Law so Moore's law was coined by Gordon Brown of Intel in the 60s and this wasn't just like a passing observation it was really I see it as a bold Proclamation uh that set the pace of technological advancements for many decades and we can see here on the this chart here is basically mapping the number of transistors on a central processing unit or on a microchip is the heart of the computer can say over you know years and you can kind of yeah it's going up to 50 50 billion um almost yeah and it's essentially following us near exponential curve um so more basically forecasts that the number of transistors transistors are the fundamental building block of computing uh on a microchip would double approximately every two years this effectively met an exponential growth uh there are some challenges and to this this this law at the moment I think it's I see it as more in evolution so today due to physical technological constraints that and it's it's potentially not doubling every two years it's not um but there's this ethos of Moore's Law so I almost think it's going to be like Morris ethos later later that Contin and I would think about it this way really that Computing will continue its rapid evolution um it'll continue that it may manifest through different types of computing like Quantum Computing or advancements in AI or other sorts of you know Innovative avenues that we haven't fully explored but I think you know the spirit will remain undeterred okay so that's Moore's Law and I think that's that's uh that's very important exponential growth in computing power okay so here's another thing that I think um is quite important and that is that we have the cost structure and this cost structure is a combination I would say of digital representation but and Moore's Law um and then graph on the right is essentially plotting the the following costs of computer so it's looking at the Consumer Price Index um from the U.S Bureau of Labor and statistics and this is like a basket of things that you would buy or you would spend money on maybe every month like rent and groceries and gas and all that stuff is cool um anyway so you could kind of see the CPI is is you know the base CPI of all items it's increasing at X percent per year but it's it's generally increasing there's like only a couple instances where it's decreasing for any any large period of time but if you pull out personal computers and peripherals that's approaching like zero that's getting very relatively speaking to the to the 1990s in this so I think that's super super interesting so another thing we have um in terms of like a feature I should say it's not a bug but a feature of this is we have high fixed costs when we're talking about um digital economics so in digital representation uh at its Inception it comes with these in substantial upfront costs they give the r d uh the infrastructure that you would need you know we have servers sitting around um and the initial production making this you know being able to produce this this thing digitally these are investments that have to be made to bring the digital technology or that product life they're the fixed costs they don't change regardless of the scale or you know of production or the number of users that you have uh but then you have this you know this other feature that's kind of going along with these fixed costs which is s transistor counts rise the number of Transit you know Moore's Law is saying the number of transistors are counts in a CPU are going to double every couple years then the costs per function per doing things with that is is just necessarily dropping and this makes digital Technologies more affordable and pervasive and this is we're going to talk about this a bit later um this is like near zero marginal costs which means once you've made this investment and you know you have the cost of producing an additional unit or serving that song over Spotify to that one person who just might sign up is essentially zero or it's very very low and that's in contrast to traditional say traditional Industries like you know where or even earlier technology Industries where you know you wrote some software but you had to put it on a CD and you had to then put the CD in a CD case and you had to print something nice and then you had to put it on a truck and send it to a store and you get it so those were additional unit costs associated with delivering that one product okay so we have exponential growth and computing power let's move again to want to talk a bit about physical digital representation just to travel back in time talk about talk about the cassettes so like and then we'll fast forward to today um because I really want to juxtapose these kind of two eras and put this in perspective for you we have okay so we have the cassette tape industry or the cassette industry or we'll call it the cassette tape era so cast your mind back to the Heyday of the cassette tape industry if you can I I ca I can't definitely um but this is like spanning the 1970s to the mid 1990s so this era and people you know living in this area consuming cassette tapes which is almost everybody um it's largely driven by physical album sales so every cassette manufactured had tangible production costs I mentioned some of that like on the last slide right you had assembly of raw materials you had packaging um the success of an album because you'd put these on the songs or albums would be on these cassettes but was often gauged by its physical sales like and the rack space it occupied in stores because people would go to stores and purchase these cassettes there okay now let's kind of like fast forward to this dawn of digital audio so transition to say the late 1990s and there's his paradigm shift that's happening and basically this Advent of digital audio and it's not the first time we're able to digitally represent audio um we're able to do that much much earlier than the 1990s and this is another separate thing we're going to talk about later in the class is like you can see these these early I would say innovations that are almost poised to take over you can see them coming it's just you know if everybody could of course they would all switch and we should ask ourselves why um and we'll do that later but talking about this dawn of the the digital audio era you know we have the music industry experiencing a seismic change right so revenue streams are exploding Music stream platforms are raking in billions of dollars a year I mean Spotify alone last quarter just the revenue is over three billion dollars right and the entire revenue for the the entire cassette industry kind of peaked at two billion dollars adjusted for inflation so Spotify alone is worth you know is is drawing in 50 more more Revenue so and and also the economic model evolves right so it's no longer just about selling like physical copies instead it Diversified to downloads or monthly subscriptions I don't know how many of you are paying a monthly subscription to be able to listen to music um there's even ad supported listening experiences um so kind of brings me to the main point it's like there's an advantage for digital I think Advantage goes to digital here and that's you know today's digital audio Realm offers us so many advantages right vast music libraries just tap on them uh you don't need to manufacture and ship uh physical tapes those physical tapes would degrade of course and digital is not I think may but digital is as ones and zeros represented on a hard drive for for quite a while is not degrading um you have you know minimal distribution costs you can reach music you can reach listeners instantaneously um so I think this this is this the cassette industry and the you know the digital audio industry juxtaposed against each other really underscores this transformative essence of digital representation to me and it's not about convenience really it's it's reshaping these entire Industries redefining all of these economic models and I guess you know as a musician it's also I think it's giving and it's broadening people's access to different areas of art and culture which are cool things um and when we talk about the long tail later on I'll I'll give a little bit more mention to this all right so we have the last kind of Big Ticket item in the presentation here uh which is modularity so kind of what sets digital apart uh I think of this as a design principle um that's foundational to the flexibility and adaptability of digital systems I'm a software engineer so I look at modularity in the constructs of building software or Hardware uh and and and also in in design so um you know what is modularity kind of at its core like I said it's a design philosophy um and just imagine build constructing or building using Lego blocks right so each block um is a is its own module and it has its own structure and it can stand independently yet when you combine these blocks you can make almost anything really you can make but you know you can integrate them seamlessly into a cohesive structure so similarly in digital systems modularity is referring to designing with distinct components or modules these modules can function on their own um but they can also come together to form a more comprehensive system I don't caveat it some of them can't really function on their own um but you know for the most part they can't like on the right I have a Graphic of the Von Neumann architecture it's kind of a case in point for me um as a computer person it's hard not to mention the Ben Neumann architecture so it's kind of the Cornerstone of modern Computing and modularity and it embodies this because you have a central processing unit you have memory you have input and output devices like your keyboard and your mouse or your speakers or your microphone or the camera and each part operates independently um yet collaboratively they're working together to process information um they're not it's not useful just to have a keyboard right it's not useful just to have a CPU but you put all of this together and then it's yeah and you have a computer um another point I want to make is kind of this power of interchangeability so this is one of one of the most striking examples of modularity is the ease of interchangeability so you know you can modules are often designed to be swapped out or replaced or upgraded entirely without disrupting the entire system so think of how you can unless you're using an Apple product how you can upgrade the RAM or the battery or you can swap things out of a computer and you don't have to change the whole thing and that design allows for adaptability it allows for longevity it allows for flexibility and it can cater to the needs of of you know the people and technological advancements um so I think that's that's important and essentially like why does this matter so I think in the digital world rapid change is the only constant and modularity ensures that you know when you're designing things or systems they remain resilient and adaptable so whether it's something like software that needs to be regularly updated or Hardware that has to be updated modularity ensures that you're not just starting from scratch every time you build upon or you enhance existing structures that exist another example that I like um I don't like it but I approve of it if that makes sense uh it's just in terms of like software so as I mentioned I'm a software engineer I love to make software um and and I like to design too um and I like the idea of modularity I would say I love the idea of modularity um so this example is is essentially showing software uh interface design and I I've pointed out like this is a screenshot from Apple's human interface design guidelines so Apple pretty synonymous with intuitive design and user centricity uh has its own set of guidelines um and these guidelines are like the sh the way that apps are shaped and the way that interfaces are designed for Apple devices you shall Thou shalt follow the design guidelines and they're not just about Aesthetics by the way they're designed as best practices to ensure that you know across the world The Experience on an Apple device is consistent it's intuitive it's seamless regardless of you know the app that the person's using on their Apple device so how does this embody modularity I mean um at the heart these guidelines really do like do build off this principle of modularity and you can see it when you're looking here like they specifically will you know talking about something like selection and input they're going to give different ways in which you know the modular components should should be implemented um so instead of presenting designers what I like about this is a set of presenting designers something that's like this this like you know monolithic set of rules the guidelines break down this huge domain of interface design into focused digestible pieces sections and components and that allows you if you're designing software you can then craft your own Innovation using these different modular pieces again it's like digital Legos it's like and you can craft a design and that design is still going to align overarchingly with the principles and consistency and intuitiveness that apple is you know demanding of you and yeah and the result from a user perspective you you know many of you do use Apple devices and you use you interact with these interfaces it's the familiar you have a familiarity with this you know how to use it so there's another really big um Pro of modular design or thinking about modularity in terms of software okay this is a little more like um in the weeds but this diagram here is in presenting it's visualizing you know software modules so if you're you know as a this was talking about design and this might be more like function so this is you know the function of software and where does modularity come into play here um and basically I'm trying to visualize here two distinct software modules with their own function and it's very clearly delineated but they're they have points at which they connect and really what this is about is um in the software world when you are you're doing the work of programming so let's say you've done the work of Designing and you have an interface you have something that looks really good um now you need to have it function being able to think modularly and understanding the value of modularity is basically going to allow you create to create these self-contained units in software like self-contained things that go along with your you know self-contained design or visuals and this matters because you know flexibility in design and development this will allow you to add or modify components and replace them without disrupting everything so you just need to replace the function that lets you add a filter to a selfie right you just need to do that and only work on that and the rest of the application and the rest of software it's not going to break and that subsequently leads to isolation and reduction of risk so you know you have this big huge modular system likely and a flaw and an error in one place is is less likely to impact other places elsewhere in the particular piece of software right and lastly what it enables you to also do is efficiently test stuff so testing is pretty straightforward when you have modularity from the beginning because you can just say Okay I want to test this module this thing in isolation and ensure that it works and once it does I can pop it into the entire system it's again back to this Lego idea if you kind of have like a Lego block that you know is composed of well multiple Lego blocks you might want to test that before you put it into the larger structure um yeah so in a nutshell modularity is not just a design principle it's also kind of the robust adaptable like bedrock in my opinion of information Technologies to be that's why it's so important um and I wanted to include that okay so we're going to move on now to talk about um why does all this matter to business like these three things um and I know I talked about marginal costs and the cost structure but I'll cover that again I think more in the Deep dive here but the main three things I want you to keep in mind are digital representation growth and computing power and modularity so why do these state three things matter to a business because you know that's one of the things on our minds in this course okay why does it matter so on this slide what do we have what do we have here because I will go out of business not necessarily but you may become less valuable right in this in particular case you know digital representation exponential growth or computing power modularity these are not just technical Concepts they transform the business landscape they have transformed the business landscape okay so in the case of the encyclopedias when we're able to digitally represent a book in an encyclopedia like that's the physical representation of that has now been completely overshadowed by Dynamic online platforms like Wikipedia because we have this immediacy this accessibility adaptability of digital information and knowledge you can disseminate that much faster um I think Encyclopedia Britannica shut down their print division in 2000 early early to mid 2000s but they no longer produce encyclopedias okay in the case of CDs we've been talking a lot about Spotify and about music streaming platforms the sheer computing power of today like facilitated this rise of music streaming gone are the days of physical CDs I mean there's still some I know I buy albums they're very expensive these are on vinyl it's more of a hipster thing um maybe hipsters will go maybe you guys will buy CDs I'm not sure they'll ever be cool vinyl's still cool but you know these markets are nowhere near as large this is why I said you may get smaller um uh yeah and what else did we have on this slide we have GameStop replacing that kind of potentially like modularity has changed the game no pun intended for video game industry right so you have platforms like steam those offer completely digital approaches you can download purchase update games content seamlessly you don't need to go out to a brick and mortar store and buy a game um on the on the flip side and the good side I suppose also is as a game developer you are now able to put out updates to your game to those people that have downloaded it you can fix bugs it's overall just yeah that's a much better experience um we have the taxi stand has a stack taxi stand completely gone away well not necessarily but it's certainly gotten smaller and the idea of a taxi has certainly gotten smaller so the taxi industry transformation I think is emblematic of all the three forces that I mentioned so you have digital representation that's in the form of app interfaces like like uber you have computing power that's enabling real-time tracking of all these cars wherever they happen to be and then you have the modularity of the different app features the fact that you can have say it's the same app but you're a driver or you're a passenger the design of that has all been modularized and it's enabled essentially the transformation of the taxi industry um uh we have Toys R Us which many of you probably haven't haven't heard of I used to hang out there as kid I would just look at toys right how has that changed well it's gone unfortunately um e-commerce's rides really showcased like digital representation in the form of online catalogs you have the computing power behind Amazon just allowing for you know analytics and personalized representations all of that I mean essentially leads to e-commerce ousting a brick and mortar toy store like Toys R Us or at least causing its business to decline so rapidly that it's now bankrupt um or much much smaller and then I don't know if I even need to talk about Blockbuster but Blockbuster Video brick and mortar store you walked in you rented videos like in certain formats um they they could be VHS which is an analog format or even DVD which was a digital format either way Along Comes Netflix which started to offer DVDs to homes so you could have a subscription service where you could have three DVDs a month or something or five DVDs a month and then you just put it back in the mail that's not the Netflix we know today Netflix we know today is completely online completely streamed again Blockbusters bankrupt Netflix's arguably thriving much much larger so when I say you know you may go out of business or you're going to become you will become less valuable so that's one of the other reasons that that digital matters to you all right I've got another another set of uh slides here specifically about Amazon so when we think about Amazon today we envision This Global e-commerce uh Behemoth right that has a number of different services like you you might be if you're a techie person you might think that they're cloud cloud service there's just AWS or if you watch a lot of streaming videos you might think about Amazon video or Amazon Prime but mainly we're thinking of Amazon like this big Global retail e-commerce behemoth yeah but it has a lot of things it's quite large and quite sprawling we'll get to that in a second um but let's rewind a bit and focus on the kind of pivotal pivot what I believe is a pivotal moment in its journey and I think this is illustrated by this consumer electronics device called the Kindle so Amazon starts humbly I guess you know selling books it's like a website they're selling books um pretty simple Vision they wanted to become the Earth's most you know consumer-centric company and they wanted to start you know with books they want to sell books so then in 2007 they introduced this e-reader called the Kindle which is a pretty big leap if you're selling books online and now you want to make a consumer electronics device pretty big um but I don't think this was just a product this was kind of a it was a it was a big statement for them it sold out in like six hours post-launch so it was highly popular highly like sought after device um and I think it wasn't just about the device though people are buying this because they're like whoa I can read without you know I can carry a bunch of books in my hand just like I could carry a bunch of songs in my hand with the iPod in 2001 right but there's a six-year Gap so what is the significance of this move for Amazon going from Bookseller to consumer electronics producer selling an e-reader right I think it's like there's a few a few big points um in terms of the significance of entering this Market um and I think it was very Monumental so first off you have the obvious synergies right so Amazon has a vast Book Repository they can then you know use that with their tailor-made device that they made themselves called the Kindle and they can offer this unparalleled reading experience okay that's pretty cool um so they're disrupting the market right the Kindle also disrupts this Market um it's disrupting the traditional book Market Paving the way in my opinion for digital reading then you also have kind of this strategic expansion so by entering they're really entering the hardware Market Amazon is diversifying its portfolio so now it's no longer just selling books it's signaling in my opinion its intent to become an e-commerce platform because if you've got the device and you're controlling say we'll say the rendering interface in the form of a Kindle who says you can't put a store there which they did who says people can't put their credit cards in and buy books from you like which they did so in a big way I think this is you know this moment at least you know Amazon introducing the Kindle which kind of is head scratching when you see it it like makes perfect sense like obviously in hindsight and I believe is one of the things that really you know super powered its entry into retail all like everything so in my opinion this launch this Kindle launch like epitomizes this transformational power of digital representation a computing power and modularity so you know Amazon uses these three pillars to craft a device it's not just about technology it was like changing the way that we consume content changing the way that you read a book so instead of reading it by turning the page you're reading it by like pressing on the e-reader screen so I think it's a good example it's a really good case study when you think about the significance of businesses that are adapting or innovating in response to this evolving like digital landscape okay so now I want to talk about another feature and that is you know the second to last one we're going to mention um I realized we've been talking for like 50 minutes or so so I want to try to keep this you know a little bit to about an hour or so um is talk about the economics of infinity uh and obviously I'm back to music right so talking about like how did we produce CDs in the past uh you know we had between load High fixed costs like this image on the left is like a thing you can buy that can do it can basically burn 100 CDs or create 100 CDs um but there's tangible production costs in this industry right so every CD produced at Associated costs you had the raw materials used in the CD and its cover you had the Machinery wear and tear the royalties paid to artists the production was finite every new CD meant more costs and then on the distribution side and the scalability side you know once you produce these CDs had to be transported to stores they had to be uh stored there was always a ceiling um there was always a limit to how many CDs could be produced and sold and this is dictated by like physical constraints and maybe demand projections and then lastly you kind of have wear and tear like physical CDs are tangible they could get damaged lost whatever stolen this is all adding to the risk and the and further costs and I guess you could return a CD if it was like not working well so so talking about the economics of Infinity CD industry not looking like Infinity to me now let's move further and look at the economics of infinity in digital so as we think about it this you know what what digital is traditional economic models are almost completely appended here at least in terms of the the supply side right so what do we have so we have high fixed costs if you're going to deliver the same product in this case it was a Tupac CD right so otherwise you know if I had a Tupac CD which I did now I can listen to Tupac on Spotify so I'm getting the same as a consumer on the demand side I want to listen to Tupac I'm listening to Tupac I'm just not listening to Tupac on a CD um you get it right but let's look at the let's look at the costs um for I don't know or the record label um in the in this world of an infinite economics or the economics of infinity here we have high fixed cost and some of these might be for example um data centers like this is a big backbone these are more than just storage facilities right they're hosting the the digital representation and they're enabling a seamless delivery of that to us um but they're not cheap um at all so there's a very high fixed cost to a data center you can rent uh parts of them of course for lower but let's just say there's High fixed costs there's also High fixed costs in creating and maintaining the infrastructure uh behind delivering the the Tupac song right behind Spotify or something you have Hardware we have things like servers and storage devices and networking equipment and all those things um then we have the software there's licenses for like operating systems like Windows or whatever needs to run on this it's probably not windows but either way there's a lot of costs there's labor costs involved right so it's no longer just like a machine pressing vinyl it's a software engineer um who's you know an expert in a particular technology who's got to help you and it's a lot of those it's like a whole group of experts that have to design and deploy and ensure this uninterrupted service to you know millions and millions and millions of people in certain cases billions right um there's immense energy requirements so um to power and operate all of this and to cool those servers obviously you got to pay rent like the data center or something you need to likely you have some rental expenses or something like that so you have very high fixed costs now on the other side if we look at the the you know service costs what's it cost to deliver the product so in our in our prior side you know we're pressing we're burning the CDs there's machines that can do that it's pretty automated hopefully it's not that high costs aren't too high maybe they are um but they could be they could be lower but we also have high variable costs because we've got all these other costs associated with delivering the CD to the stores and all the stuff we spoke about before but what makes digital different and why we say the economics Infinity is because the variable costs or the cost per unit of this song like if I just when I'm done with this video I'm just going to play play this song and it's going to cost Spotify zero or close to zero right so the the platforms like Spotify in my mind like enable or epitomize this new wave of kind of Digital Services they have very very low variable costs infrastructure is fixed right but the incremental cost to serve an additional person Spotify has like say a billion listeners which they don't and they want to serve a billion and one that incremental cost is like minimal bandwidth related to like processing the registration of the person and then you know they're streaming it to them and that's and then there's royalty fees of course which I would say I would hope are not variable um but they probably are right if you're Taylor Swift like the additional person listening to Taylor Swift is probably you know Taylor Swift's unfortunately uh not probably getting as much money but we get the point right so there's very low variable costs so right so almost like an infinite potential for digital here so you have near zero marginal costs lunch content is digitized once we have additional representation of it we can distribute it at countless times occurs virtually no extra cost another point is it's infinitely or it's near infinitely scalable so like a a chart-topping song in the CD era it could go on the radio right but if it's going to go on CD and you want to listen to it on demand you have to have that CD there's limited market potential maybe you're in a place with no CD stores then you're out of luck right but if you have an internet connection you know that song can reach millions of people instantaneously doesn't have to get on a boat doesn't have to do anything it's like it's the song drops and it's like you're listening to it and lastly we've talked about this a bit we have this durability and longevity so digital like it defies time for the most part and um so digitally produced song can retain that quality as long as you're maintaining your Hardware is you've got the ones and zeros you could write them down if you really had a lot of time and you're going to be able to preserve that record um right so I want to then you know to talk about like question I originally kind of posed when we started talking about economics is again is everybody going out of business except for like Spotify and and Amazon and Google [Music] um yeah so this is one way to yeah this is one way to stay I guess is a massive bundling so this is one of the quintessential strategies of the digital age and we have seen this now and it's like allowing businesses to provide this array of services or products underneath a unified umbrella sounds like a monopoly in some ways but we'll get to that maybe later or I'm sure you could take a class that really really delves deeply into this especially related to tech companies but let's go ahead and look at two models right to understand this kind of this concept of bundling a little bit better so first we have the New York Times so looking here at the New York Times production chain we have the printing press produce newspapers each print run there's costs ink paper Machines labor that stuff and you put it on delivery truck uh that's Logistics you got fuel you have personnel tick more costs and then you reach the end consumer it's a culmination it's the reader the person doing the crossword puzzle whatever um they get that delivered to their doorstep they read it they drink a little bit of espresso and then they you know maybe they throw it away or they use it for painting who knows um okay now let's talk about Amazon's model right and we can argue Amazon could provide the same things right but here's how Amazon's model is working so specifically Amazon Prime which is their bundling their their bundling I guess brand if you will so they have a Data Center and we talked about those earlier and this is kind of the backbone of you know of a lot of the production right so they're hosting platform they're processing transactions they're running algorithms to recommend things to you all this is happening digitally um all of it is becoming digitally represented of course there's Hardware involved okay so then we have Amazon Prime basically this is kind of symbolizing the subscription service that offers not just shopping but other benefits like there's a bunch of other things that you get like I think you get your packages delivered faster you get access to video you have a bunch of other things that you can do and Amazon is essentially bundling Goods like it it through this this particular brand but it's Amazon right so Amazon is massively bundling different types of things and you know this bundle of goods like the diapers and the movie which actually is Disney so it's not going to be on Prime um but all of this stuff is basically underneath the Amazon Prime umbrella and so you have this you know Myriad of products and digital services that are all available so that's one of the strategies you can massively bundle like and I want to contrast that with a more traditional model like the the earlier New York Times of course I understand that they also now bundle things um and they have Digital Services of course but the traditional model with that linear supply chain you know so you can sip your espresso and read the paper is contrasted by this Digital model epitomized by Amazon Prime which is just leveraging massive bundling like you have this initial investment infrastructure and then you can bundle lots of services that add value to people and people do get value but you're not significantly hiking costs right if you're Amazon as if you're the New York Times you can't it's hard to bundle with that particularly linear supply chain give you one additional example we're almost done I promise um so in the realm of Gaming like you know there's transformation and there's massive bundling that happens here too like and I think you know let's just journey through this transition so again let's just call it the NES cartridge era where you had these single game cartridges I don't think that's an NES cartridge I think that's a maybe Nintendo 64 cartridge but close enough um you know each cartridge represents a single gaming experience we're thinking about the consumer those Super Mario Brothers have the cartridge it is Super Mario Brothers it is not Zelda or something um players purchased or parents purchased these games each cartridge had its own production costs its own distribution costs its own retail cost then by the way you have this focused engagement on the you know Post delivery side I guess like we have the focused engagement with reading the paper you're focused on that you're playing the one game you invested in a game that's the sole experience you're getting okay now let's contrast this and by the way I completely realized that Nintendo has the switch and Nintendo has online stores but you know just to kind of contrast the before times with today you know talk about the Advent of Apple arcade so we have the same starting point the data center if you will the computer the digital representation the zeros and the ones and then you have this subscription I think we're gonna get in our heads like there's these subscription models that are that seem to be a popular business model for these um but it's not the only one so we had the subscription I think it's called Apple arcade and yeah like for a single fee you get access to this vast library of games other different whatever so they have like 200 games last I checked or a little more than that and they're different types of games and you can choose to play them and I think this juxtaposition makes things even more clear like the NES cartridge area to era to me it's very charming and it's pretty cool and I like the element of dedicated engagement personally I think that's a really cool thing um but then you have platforms like apple arcade it's showcasing like the power of massive bundling we look at the cartridge Market adjusted for inflation with the you know the streaming not even streaming the video game Market the digital distribution like subscription-based video game Market they're not even comparable right they're much larger um so in an argument can be made that it's just delivering more value in you know being able to massively bundle all right so let's make a statement and that is I think competitive advantage comes from controlling the digital storefront and the rendering interface so if you are a business and you are you're not Amazon but you're one that's facing some disruption some digital disruption here like how are you gonna gain competitive Advantage well you do what the other businesses have done and this these are the two things I think sets you apart give you a tech a competitive Advantage so this might sound technical but really I think it's about dictating how users access interact with and experience your digital products your digital offerings and if you control those touch points you're ensuring consistency You're Building brand identity um and I think you know another example give kind of the Apple App Store example because it's pretty classic it's quintessential in my mind in talking about controlling the storefront right so in the case of the Apple App Store we all know how this works you must um you know you must have your app must be approved by Apple it goes on the App Store the only way to install software on an Apple device unless you're a developer is to do it through the app store or for it to come to come pre-installed by Apple themselves um so yeah so what does this really kind of embody so from Apple's perspective you have quality control so they have a rigorous view review process for their App Store um and and they're ensuring standards and guaranteeing a certain level of quality and security um by doing this like you maintain you know you're maintaining control over the storefront which is what you want to do and that's ensuring for apple and its users it's ensuring this kind of seamless experience right every app as we mentioned earlier every app kind of feels inherently Appley um and another important thing if you're a business is it's it it's revenue streams like you're controlling the storefront you're controlling like that's translating into monetary benefits for Apple they're dictating terms I think it's 30 in many cases and you're ensuring this steady stream of Revenue significant revenue from App sales and in-app purchases and that's a big part of what makes Apple so valuable so in some you know Apple's App Store kind of exemplifies how controlling the digital storefront um can be can be pivotable pivotal sorry it's not just about like hosting the app you're not putting a place for people to host apps Google has a play store for that by the way it's more about crafting in Apple's case this ecosystem um and making kind of a call it a little bit of a fortress um this screenshot here I won't go over too much of it essentially it's like it's a screen cap from Apple's App Store review guidelines and just to give you an example of how in-depth it is as a developer of apps like before I can publish an app I have to go through Apple's review process and you know it's many many pages and there are quite a lot of requirements but again this is this is for me as a producer of apps right somebody making content that Apple might want to you know receive 30 revenue from I still must go through quite a rigorous process of review and talking about the storefront specifically talking about the Apple storefront um I also kind of want to highlight you know that this is not all it's not all wonderful at least depending on your perspective because storefronts can act as a pretty strong barrier to entry and if we consider you know Apple's tight control over its App Store you know this in this case case I'm going to talk about in a second I think really illustrates how it can be quite a barrier to entry I think few cases are going to illustrate this like hustle more better than like this apple versus epic games so you know as we discussed like Apple's app store it's not just a marketplace right it's a meticulously crafted ecosystem and Apple's control is ensuring of the F quality and user experience in my kind of crucially you have a steady Revenue stream um the commission within apps and and now we have enter epic games maker of fortnite which I think you've all heard of um epic games is a they make a game engine which is fortnite it's made a game engine is basically the thing you make you can make games in you can program them um but either way you know and they they make a little bit of money from royalties for that but they made fortnite in their own game engine and made quite a bit of uh Revenue just through the fortnite franchise itself so yeah so enter fortnite um arguably one of the most popular games you know globally um epic introduced their own kind of in-app payment system so if you wanted to buy like skins for your character you want to look like a clown or something like that um you could go through the Epic store on your I I you know your your Apple device and that was a direct challenge to Apple's very tight control over the app store right it's that's skirting the revenue piece of that and so Apple was pretty yeah the Fallout was Swift um fortnite was removed from the App Store a legal battle follows like it brought to the Forefront um and I hinted at this a little bit earlier but it really brought to the Forefront legally this this this question of Monopoly control or like you want to control the storefront and you want to control the rendering interface and you're bundling a lot of products so you know this is really you know bringing to the 4 from this question of Monopoly control and barriers to entry specifically in the digital realm I know we've been talking about business for an hour and 13 minutes almost um but there is this other element to these um to digital representation and growth and computing power and modularity that has enabled potentially some of these companies to act in ways that are maybe not good for their competition or arguably not good at all in the Crux of of epic's argument was about these barriers to entry like by controlling the App Store Apple sets non-negotiable terms and effectively dictates the rules for you um yeah and I think that again I've mentioned this I think this apple versus epic case really underscores this issue another issue in the digital age is like who controls the storefronts so it's a business you want to control the storefront which I said you know the platforms where customers interact with products and services that they're not just channels anymore they're like the centers of power if you have that you have many many channels if you're controlling the storefront um the next part is you want to control the rendering interface and this is a bit more kind of straightforward right so if you control the rendering interface this is like the visual interactive layer that people engage with you can customize it you control it like you can ensure that people have a user experience like the drop down is what they expect it to be um it's pretty it's pretty straightforward I guess more importantly by crafting this you know experience and controlling this this this rendering interface you know you're a brand you can tailor that you can optimize it you can keep people loyal but okay but on the flip side you're I would say you could stifle competition or you could erect a pretty strong barrier to entry right and this very control can become this formidable barrier it's like when you're dominating the rendering interface like apple can dominate the rendering interface on the Kindle um then you're essentially controlling the primary touch point at which potential customers are engaging like competitors have no no room left to to to present their offerings unless perhaps you sell them some space and they pay you right um so in essence you kind of like turn what could be a Digital Playground into a Walled Garden um so I would say you know you definitely need to have fairly delicate balance like it's attempting to exert control over the rendering interface when you have it but it's also not necessarily fostering healthy competition and in and Innovation and maybe not keeping that market as vibrant as it can be okay so let's talk about the last topic I realize it's an hour and 16 minutes um so I will try to finish up in the next four minutes five minutes or so I'll talk about the long tail so the long tail is something this concept was popularized by Chris Anderson I believe you guys are going to read a short um piece about this but it's crucial in understanding the changing landscape of business um so here I'm kind of trying to visualize the long tail for you on the x-axis we have a range of products and the y-axis is their popularity the curve starts High represented by mainstream products and then tapers off kind of to the more Niche stuff those who like customized Yak embroidery versus Frozen um so it's also kind of illustrating in a way like uh this this this shift from you know mainstream products to digital Niche ones like in it you know if we compare the two like traditional versus digital in a brick and mortar World businesses would be focusing on the left side of the curve right the hits the Blockbusters the products that guarantee sale so that are likely to guarantee sale so you know shell space is limited um stocking Niche products with low turnovers not going to make economic sense you've got to hold the inventory but then you enter the digital realm and you have Amazon and you have Spotify and you have all these other platforms and the game has changed because you have virtually unlimited shelf space so you can stock like stocking costs are basically zero NADA so right so why does this matter well with a long tail strategy you can tap into the idea is it you can tap into this vast ly underserved Market so while each Niche product may have low sales volumes like not going to be that many people interested in customized Yak embroidery cumulatively they could represent a significance kind of like this pink portion they could represent significant Revenue stream for you so you know and furthermore you know if you're offering like uh diverse Niche products you like like are you likely to build a little bit of loyalty with users and you know they may feel like oh I can find what I'm looking for in these weird Niche areas like if I come to your storefront right so that's that's the idea behind the long the long tail and I think the implications who talk about digital economics for this is It's really challenging those traditional economic business models right so it underscores that you need scale diversity personalization in digital it's much easier to do that obviously um right so what's driving the like what are some of the drivers of this long tail concept like what's propelling this shift from mainstream to Niche in the digital Marketplace well I think I talked about it infinite shell space right so we've got that whether it's ebooks songs apps any digital product there's really no real limit how many items can be stocked you also have another piece here which is the power of algorithms so like in a sea of endless choices how do I find what I'm looking for or better yet maybe I want to discover something new so you know if you have sophisticated algorithms you have tools that can analyze my behavior or my preferences what I've searched for before like you're able to surface that recommendation and get people to potentially likely purchase it or if you're YouTube you're watching this stuff right so even obscure products can find markets where they maybe weren't able to find those in the past and then lastly we have kind of the Democracy democratization of production so the digital age is not only transformed consumption but also production we've talked about this so you know computers are becoming powerful affordable we sell the curve like uh you know this is making things more accessible so um it could be like self-published Indie artists and making your own music and all of that stuff like or making your own games like a lot of the barriers to entry are significantly lowered which again I think enables this this more democratization user created content is one thing like but it means that more and more people can create more and more things so kind of in essence the long tail in the digital realm it's more of a consequence in my opinion of oh it's not a shifting consumer preferences like I don't think people's preferences are changing as much it's more of this manifestation of technological advancements algorithmic intelligence like democratization and production so these are some of the these are some of the big drivers okay last topic is digital disintermediation so talking about digitalization digitization we've talked a lot about we've hinted a lot about these Supply chains being kind of reimagined and I think central to this point is this concept of digital disintermediation so I'm going to kind of break down what this means and the implications so the first is like redefining um intermediaries like you know historically Supply chains they had like it punctuated by a lot of people in the middle like firms and people that were acting in the middle of this these you know facilitating the Journey of the product from you know producer to Consumer so lots of people in the middle digital processes are rapidly making these intermediaries redundant like they're not they're really not needed right so I guess in the case of Amazon if you do buy a a toy like I did yesterday it's going to go on a truck somebody's going to deliver it right but in other cases with Spotify there's nobody delivering the music to me right um another piece we have this direct to Consumer model so this is another profound impact of digital disintermediation is you can just go directly to Consumers Brands can go directly to Consumers they can now interact in that market they can sell directly to Consumers I think this not only improves margins if you're a business but it also helps you have this more personal relationship with consumers um we talked about Niche content so we can now like distribute like Niche content like riskier stuff and I mean like risky in the sense of like it's not going to sell right um but you don't need these traditional intermediaries there's not like a distributor saying no I'm sorry you can't sell that here um so you can ultimately produce at lower costs okay and then enter the aggregators right so these are like I'm talking about traditional intermediaries not needed but the new intermediary I guess is like the the marketplaces the aggregators they they're playing this pivotal role they're the platforms right they're pulling together or aggregating all these consumers they're the Uber they're the Spotify they're the Facebook they're the Amazon and they're connecting this demand side and connecting them with this maybe smaller supply side in certain cases so we can think of lots of different platform examples or aggregator examples I mean one that comes to mind is just like Etsy if we're talking about Niche products it's connecting Artisans with Buyers around the world or we talk about Spotify that's aggregating music connecting it with listeners um right so I think that you know and just to conclude we're about an hour and 24 24 minutes which is not so bad um you might be listening to this at 2x in which case it's you know you're almost you're almost to 45 minutes or so um just in conclusion talk about this digital disintermediation it's not really just about removing the middle people disintermediating them it's more about a restructuring in my mind of like how products and services are reaching the end consumer it's about empowering these Niche producers it's fostering these direct relationships uh and and really recognizing the power of the platform um yeah and so that is everything for me uh on this this talk about digital economics I hope you enjoyed it apologies for the length but it is what it is that's those are the slides uh let me know what you think and I will see you guys in class"
